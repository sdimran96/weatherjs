# weatherjs

### A sample web-application that makes use of WUnderground API to fetch weather information. Follow up for the geolocation API integration to fetch the user's location when the program initially runs.

## Prerequisites

There's no rocket science. Built using pure Javascript (ES2015 and 2016 syntax). Just download the project and run it using live-server. You are good to go. 

### Thanks for stopping by!.
